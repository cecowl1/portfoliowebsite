                Spring 2022 <br>
                Adobe InDesign <br>
                6inx6in Booklet <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                PROBLEM:
                Students were asked to develop a creative songbook using only the typeface chosen with the song. All shapes used within the design must also come from letters and glyphs within the specific typeface. 
                <br>
                <br>
                SOLUTION: 
                I chose Vienna by Billy Joel, a song that sounds somber, but is fun and playful at heart. The colors used reminded me of childhood fun and never wanting to grow up, a theme that is continuous throughout the song. I used a modern Sans Serif typeface to create simplicity throughout the busy background and changing foreground of lyric text with different weights from the font family.</p>

            <p id="type"> 
                GRDSN150 <br>
                Fall 2022 <br>
                Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign <br>
                12-page, 4.72inx4.72in Booklet <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                PROBLEM:
                Students were tasked with researching a famous Graphic Designer, studying their work, and imitating their design style. The finished product was implied to be something that could relate to us, as well as the designer. 
                <br>
                SOLUTION:
                All designs were created using InDesign and Illustrator using multiple layers of text, shapes, pictures, and other design elements to help mimick Chantry’s use of silk-screening. My final product was CD packaging that highlighted Chantry’s work with music and underground bands while mixing the nostalgia of my childhood. The five songs featured on the CD are the top five Billboard songs from the year I was born, 2002. </p>
