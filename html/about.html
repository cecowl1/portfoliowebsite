    CAILYN COWLEY
    <br>
    <br>
    I started my graphic design career at Illinois Central College where I received an Associate’s in Art after completing the graphic design sequence. From there, I transferred to Illinois State University after acceptance into the program to receive a Bachelor’s in Fine Arts: Graphic Design. <br>

    My passions within graphic design include typography, packaging design, and logo design. I am starting to explore and broaden my knowledge in graphic design conducting experiments, using different color palettes, and creating different moods within my student projects to strengthen my portoflio. I want to continue with a career in graphic design, preferably working for a design agency and getting the opportunity to travel around the world.
