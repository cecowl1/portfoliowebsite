                PROBLEM:
                Students were asked to create an informational graphic conveying the importance of sustainability in our environment today. These posters were encourged to emphasize the importance of your topic to the audience of our peers around campus.
                <br>
                <br>
                SOLUTION:
                For this project, I focused on how “bee-ing” kinder to bees would benefit society, specifically the rich Midwest farmland. The poster includes ten informational graphics that relate to the importance of protecting the bees. I used a brown, yellow, orange color combination to enhance the bee ‘feeling’ and used honeycomb shapes to tie the information to the concept.

                PROBLEM:
                Students were asked to create a multi-page book about a specific country. All illustrations, information graphics, and illustrations were not allowed to be from outside sources. A typographic system and color palette were required for the project. 
                <br>
                <br>
                SOLUTION:
                I chose to do my countrybook on Austria with a primary color palette. I chose an abstract illustration style to contradict the facts and statistics and balance the design and information. This allows the book to provide the reader information without being too boring to learn.
