                Fall 2023 <br>
                Adobe Illustrator <br>
                Poster, Festival Passes, Social Media, Merchandise, and Branding Guide
                <br>
                <br>
                PROBLEM:
                Students were asked to take another student's creative brief for a made-up festival and make it come to life! A poster, passes, schedule, wordmark, social media, and branding guide.
                <br>
                SOLUTION: 
                I was given the 'Night of Crystasls' festival brief. I wanted to make something that was modern, but also fun. To do this, I used neon colors on dark text and a mix of organic and geometric, repeating shapes to catch the viewer's eye. I chose events and schedules that would relate to the person who would be attending a crystal festival.

                Fall 2022 <br>
                Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign <br>
                3 mug labels, instruction label, and seed packets
                <br>
                <br>
                PROBLEM:
                Students were given a pre-existing brand, Burpee Seed Co., and were asked to develop a creative packaging concept that was sustainable and realistic. Target audience, color/feeling related to sustainability, and purpose were all to be considered as the idea developed into something more. 
                <br>
                <br>
                SOLUTION:
                I created a series of three mugs, each specific to a certain region–Northwest, Midwest, Southwest–that contained seeds that were safe for the pollinators specific to the area. The mugs contained an instruction booklet, seed packet, sticker label on bottom, and the peel-away packaging on the mug. My target audience was middle-older aged women who could use the seeds to beautify their yards and reuse the mugs daily to ultimately reduce the waste that comes with the packaging.
